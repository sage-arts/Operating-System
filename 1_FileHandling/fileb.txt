consider the bird as our system, while the environment consists of tap, water leaking from the tap and the climate. as the system consists of a living organism its ideal behaviour supported by the structure is to drink water. so, the system or the bird tries to achieve steady state by making its expected behaviour similar to ideal behaviour by functioning to obtain water leaking from the tap present in the environment.
